# SQL Challenge

## Working Process

Completing this challenge was more straight forward than many of the recent Homework Assignments. First, I used quickdatabasediagrams.com to help visualize the data and construct the corresponding tables. Moving to pgAdmin, creating the requisite tables was rather simple as well since many of the table sonly had two elements inside them. Once that was complete, I methodically broke down each analysis question and wrote the proper SQL code to obtain the desired results.
